# Zemya — working instructions

Read this before touching anything. It records decisions already made so they don't get
relitigated each session.

## What this is

An interactive atlas for learning geography (later: history), built around one idea —
every subject has a natural spatial index, and you learn by navigating it. Geography's
index is the map; history's is the timeline. They share one data model. Events happen in
places.

Owner: Kiril (@kirilchobansky). Solo project. Bulgarian; "Zemya" = Земя, earth.

## Where this is

Updated every commit. One place that answers "what works, what's next" — read this
before reconstructing it from `git log`.

**Working:**
- The atlas: canvas map at full 1:10m unsimplified coastline detail, search, neighbour
  highlighting, true-size compare tool, 5 choropleth overlays plus a mastery overlay.
- 197 countries (see "What counts as a country" below), each hand-authored in
  `content/` and joined against `world-countries` + Natural Earth at build time,
  including Kosovo and Micronesia's currency (both closed data-join gaps, not upstream
  facts) and every country that crosses the antimeridian (Russia, the USA, Kiribati,
  Fiji, New Zealand) rendering and flying-to correctly.
- Real flag images (`public/flags/`, from flag-icons, offline, emoji fallback on error).
- Progress and scheduling: FSRS cards per (country, facet), created lazily, mastery
  derived never stored, IndexedDB via Dexie, export/import/reset.
- Study mode: 9 question kinds, session policy (due cards first, then new cards
  population-weighted, never the same country twice in a row), a religion-specificity
  taxonomy so distractors can't be a parent/child of the correct answer.
- Solo git workflow: commits go straight to `main`, no branches, no CI (removed
  on purpose — see Git conventions).

**Next:**
- The `location` facet still has no question kind — it needs map-click interaction,
  which is why `ASKABLE_FACETS` filters it out rather than removing it from
  `applicableFacets()`. This is the next piece of study mode, not a bug.
- The study-mode hint (reveals one wrong option, downgrades a correct answer to FSRS
  Hard) was a judgement call, not something requested in detail — confirm with the
  owner it's the right shape before building more on top of it.
- Watch whether full 1:10m detail makes micro-state pins noisy in practice now that
  small islands that used to simplify away are rendering (see the Map engine row
  below). Report it if so — do not silently re-simplify to hide it.

**Known rough edges:**
- `npm test` (the Playwright smoke test) cannot run in this sandbox — Chromium is
  missing system shared libraries here and there's no passwordless sudo to install
  them. Every session so far has substituted `typecheck` + `build:content` +
  `react-router build` + `test:unit`, plus a real render of the affected geometry
  through node-canvas for anything visual, but the owner should run the real smoke
  test after pulling to be sure.
- Nigeria's religion value was reordered to "larger share first" using CIA World
  Factbook figures (~53.5% Muslim vs ~45.9% Christian, 2018 est.) for consistency with
  the rest of `content/` — Nigeria hasn't asked religion in a census since 1963
  precisely because the true split is contested, so treat that specific ordering as a
  judgement call to revisit if the owner has a source they trust more.
- README.md's licensing section still frames repo visibility as a future decision
  ("before this repo is made public"); the Locked decisions table below already
  settled that the repo is public now. Left alone deliberately — visibility and
  licensing are different decisions, and only the first is actually locked.

## What counts as a country

197 entities: 193 UN member states, plus Vatican City and Palestine (UN permanent
observers), plus Taiwan and Kosovo.

The rule: de facto control of territory, its own capital and its own borders, AND
meaningful international recognition. That admits Kosovo (recognised by about 115
states) and Taiwan (11 states, plus de facto economic relations with nearly everyone).
It excludes Somaliland (recognised by none) and Northern Cyprus (recognised only by
Türkiye) — both of which meet the de facto test and fail the recognition one. It also
excludes Greenland, Hong Kong, Macau and Puerto Rico (not self-governing states) and
Western Sahara (no effective control of its territory).

This is an editorial line, not a fact. Recognition counts are approximate and change;
the line is written down so it stays consistent, not because it is objective.

Excluded territories are drawn, dim and unclickable, so the map has no holes — except
the ones listed below, which are drawn as part of the country whose shape they are.

### Absorbed territories

Somaliland, Northern Cyprus and a handful of smaller cases are not drawn as separate
dim shapes: their geometry is merged into a real country's at build time, so the map
never shows a hole where recognised territory should be. The full list, and the reason
for each, lives in `scripts/build-content.mjs`'s `ABSORB` map — Somaliland into Somalia,
Baikonur into Kazakhstan, Northern Cyprus/the UN buffer zone/Akrotiri/Dhekelia into
Cyprus, Guantanamo Bay into Cuba, the Siachen Glacier into India. If Somalia looks like
it's missing its north-west again, or Kazakhstan has a hole in the middle again, look
there before touching the geometry-matching code — the fix is a map entry, not a
special case in `topology.ts`.

## Locked decisions — do not reopen without asking

| Decision | Choice | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Platform | Web, PWA-installable | Install friction kills education tools. Deep links are the only free acquisition channel. |
| Framework | React 19 + Vite 8 + TypeScript + React Router **v8** (framework mode) | Owner already knows React. The perf-critical part is canvas, which is framework-agnostic. Framework mode pre-renders, so `/country/bulgaria` is a crawlable document. (v8, not the v7 first discussed — v8 is current and the config is the same shape.) |
| Hosting | Cloudflare Pages, fully static | No server needed. Free. Preview URL per PR. |
| Backend | **None for now** | Ship without accounts. Local-first from day one so adding sync later costs nothing in perceived speed. |
| Storage | IndexedDB via **Dexie 4.4.6**, local-first | Every interaction must be 0 ms. Never block UI on network. |
| Scheduling | **ts-fsrs 5.4.2** (FSRS), not SM-2, not the prototype's 3-in-a-row toy | Modern open algorithm, real intervals and due dates. MIT, open-spaced-repetition org, actively maintained — checked before pinning. |
| Map engine | Custom canvas renderer, **not** Leaflet/MapLibre. Coastlines are **1:10m, unsimplified** (~3.4 MB raw, 687 KB gzipped) | Tiles need a network; a vector-only engine gives true-size re-projection and exact hit-testing for free, and does the pedagogical things a general-purpose library makes harder. Revisit only when city/street detail is actually wanted. Measured before shipping unsimplified: paints in ~585 ms, pans at a solid 60 fps. |
| Repo visibility | Public | Made public so this sandbox can read it. Secrets still never enter the repo. |

## Structure

```
prototype/              frozen reference build — read it, port from it, never develop in it
content/geography/      hand-authored YAML, one file per country. THE MOAT.
scripts/                content/ + upstream datasets -> public/data/
app/root.tsx            the HTML document itself + the top-level App
app/routes.ts           the route table
app/entry.client.tsx    hydrates the prerendered document
app/entry.server.tsx    renders each route to HTML at build time
app/lib/core/           scheduler + Dexie store. subject-agnostic; no geography imports.
app/lib/map/            projection, topology, camera, renderer, controller. no React.
app/lib/geography/      overlays, client payload loader, *.server.ts catalog readers,
                        mastery derivation
app/lib/format.ts       shared formatting and normalisation
app/components/         Rail, SearchBox, and future panels
app/routes/             atlas.tsx (layout, owns the canvas) + panel routes
app/styles/             tokens.css then app.css
public/data/geography/  generated, committed on purpose
public/flags/           generated from flag-icons, committed on purpose
test/smoke.mjs          end-to-end browser test against the production build
```

React Router's framework mode fixes two of these names: the app lives in `app/`, and
static assets in `public/` (not `src/` and `static/`, as first sketched).

**This is not a renamed `src/`, and the Vite-template files are not missing.** Framework
mode replaces all three of them:

| Vite SPA template | here |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | `app/root.tsx` — its `Layout` export renders `<html>`/`<head>`/`<body>` |
| `src/main.tsx` | `app/entry.client.tsx` — `hydrateRoot(document, …)`, not `#root` |
| `src/App.tsx` | `app/routes.ts` (route table) + `root.tsx`'s `<Outlet/>` |

The entry files were materialised with `react-router reveal`; framework mode generates
them invisibly otherwise. Converting to the SPA layout would cost prerendering (197
crawlable country pages), `*.server.ts` stripping, and build-time loaders — see the
locked decisions above.

`app/entry.client.tsx` and `app/entry.server.tsx` are React Router's default entry
points, revealed deliberately so the boot sequence is visible rather than generated and
hidden. They are now maintained in this repo and will **not** receive upstream updates —
treat them as configuration, not application code, and check them against upstream
defaults after any React Router major upgrade.

Rules that follow from this layout:

- `content/` must stay editable by a non-programmer. Plain YAML/text, no code, no build
  step required to read it. It may move to its own repo later — don't couple it to `src/`.
- Generated data is **committed**, not built at deploy time. A content edit shows up as a
  diff in both `content/` and `public/data/`.
- `app/lib/map/` must not import React or anything from `app/lib/geography/`. It is a
  standalone renderer; the globe projection and the history timeline will both reuse it.
- `app/lib/core/` must not import from `app/lib/geography/`, or anything geography-specific
  at all. Card ids are opaque strings to it; history will use the same store one day.
- Anything reading `public/data/*.json` from disk lives in a `*.server.ts` file, so the
  bundler strips it from the client. A 154 KB catalogue must never ship to a browser
  twice.
- Route loaders run at **build time** — every page is prerendered. Node APIs are fine in
  them; `window` is not.

## Interaction principles

> The camera moves only when the user could not already see the target. Clicking a country
> on the map never moves the camera; arriving from search, a link, or a cold URL does.
> Any new way of selecting a country must decide which of those two it is.

| What I do | Camera |
| --- | --- |
| Click a country on the map | does NOT move |
| Click empty ocean (deselect) | does NOT move |
| Pick a result from search | flies to it |
| Click a neighbour chip in the dossier panel | flies to it |
| Click a suggestion on the index panel | flies to it |
| Open /country/<slug> cold (fresh load or shared link) | flies to it |
| Press the ⌂ reset button | returns to world view |
| Wheel, drag, pinch, double-click | unchanged |

Intent travels as React Router location state: `state={{ fly: true }}` on a `Link`,
`{ state: { fly: true } }` on `navigate()`. The map's own click handler passes nothing.
`flyTo` and `home` on the Atlas controller are unchanged by this rule — it governs who
calls them, not what they do.

## Progress and scheduling

A country is not one thing you know — you can know Bulgaria's capital and not its
currency — so the unit of scheduling is a **(country, facet) pair**, one FSRS card each.
Facets: `location`, `capital`, `flag`, `currency`, `language`, `religion`, `borders`,
`outline`. A facet only applies when the country has the data for it (no `borders` card
for an island, no `currency` card where the field is null); the applicable set is the
denominator for mastery, computed per country in `app/lib/geography/mastery.ts`.

Card ids are `subject:entity:facet` strings — `geo:BGR:capital` — prefixed so history can
later write `hist:treaty-of-berlin:date` into the same tables without collision. The
prefix is a geography-layer convention, not a core concept: `app/lib/core/` stores and
grades opaque id strings and must never import from `app/lib/geography/`.

Cards are created **lazily**. No row exists until a facet is first reviewed — "new" is the
absence of a row, not a row in a new state. 197 countries never means 1,576 rows up front.

Country mastery is **derived, never stored**, from whatever cards exist for it:
- **new** — no cards for this country
- **learning** — at least one card exists
- **mastered** — every applicable facet has a card that has graduated to FSRS `Review`

"Graduated to Review" is FSRS's own definition of learned; do not invent a threshold.

**Writes are never awaited by the UI.** `app/lib/core/progress.ts` updates in-memory state
synchronously and renders immediately — `saveCard` and `logReview` are fire-and-forget,
log a failure and move on. Only the explicit export / import / reset operations are async,
because the user asked for them and is watching.

**SSR guard.** Route loaders run at build time, where `indexedDB` does not exist. Nothing
in `app/lib/core/` touches `indexedDB` at module scope — the Dexie instance is constructed
lazily behind a browser check, so importing the store from a route module is inert during
prerender. If `npm run build` starts failing inside prerender, look here first.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev             # dev server on :5173
npm run build           # build:content, then prerender 199 static pages
npm run build:content   # content/ -> public/data/geography/
npm run typecheck       # react-router typegen && tsc --noEmit
npm test                # serves build/client and drives a real browser
npm run test:unit       # vitest — pure-logic tests (scheduler, mastery), no browser
```

`npm test` requires a completed `npm run build`. In this sandbox pass
`CHROMIUM_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`.

`npm run test:unit` needs no build — it exercises `app/lib/core/` and
`app/lib/geography/mastery.ts` directly, importing real content through the same
`catalog.server.ts` reader every route loader uses.

(In `prototype/`: `npm install && npm run build`.)

## Git conventions

Solo project, one machine, one person. No branches, no pull requests, no CI.

- Work directly on `main`. Do not create branches. Do not open pull requests.
- Commit when a change works. Small commits are fine; perfect commits are not required.
- Commit subject: imperative, lower case, no trailing period. One line is enough.
- Before committing, run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build:content`. If content
  changed, commit the regenerated public/data in the same commit.
- Running the browser smoke test is optional. It is a tool for me, not a gate.
- This sandbox can read the repo but not push. Leave commits unpushed; the owner
  clicks Sync in VS Code.
- If you make a decision the prompt did not specify — a name, a data shape, a
  trade-off, a deviation — record it in CLAUDE.md in the same commit. CLAUDE.md is
  the only channel between this machine and whoever is reviewing the work elsewhere.
  A decision that lives only in a commit message or a chat reply is a decision that
  gets relitigated.
- Update "## Where this is" in every commit that changes what works.

## Visual identity

Committed single dark theme — a chart room, not a generic dashboard. Do not add a light
theme without asking; do not drift toward the default "near-black + one neon accent" look.

Tokens live in `app/styles/tokens.css` and are the single source of truth — except for
`--land` and the micro-state pin, which the canvas renderer needs as literals in
`app/lib/map/renderer.ts`. Change one, change both.

## Content conventions

- Memory hooks are one sentence, concrete, and surprising. They are not encyclopaedia
  summaries. "Belgium once went 589 days without a government" — not "Belgium is a country
  in Western Europe."
- Flag descriptions describe *geometry and colour* so they can be read aloud without the
  flag visible.
- Outline descriptions describe *silhouette* — the shape as a thing you'd recognise.
- Religion values are deliberately specific (Eastern Orthodoxy, Sunni Islam, Theravada
  Buddhism), not coarse buckets. The faith↔language matching round depends on it.
- Quiz only on falsifiable facts: dates, places, actors, sequence. Never quiz causation.
- Overrides exist only to close upstream data gaps. Each must carry a `note` saying
  why upstream is wrong and how that was established. Never use an override to express
  an opinion — if a fact is disputed, don't quiz it.
- Hooks are written as fragments with an implied subject. Any surface that shows a hook
  outside the country's own page must supply the subject itself.

## Do not

- Do not add subjects beyond geography until geography ships and has users. The multi-subject
  vision shapes the *architecture*, not the roadmap.
- Do not add accounts, a database, or any server call in the first release.
- Do not introduce a map tile provider or API key.
- Do not put secrets in the repo. `.env` is gitignored; `.env.example` is committed.
- Do not use `localStorage` as the primary store — IndexedDB, with a guarded fallback.
- Do not hand-write bulk historical content later; seed from Wikidata and hand-write only
  the hooks.
- Do not enable lazy route discovery. A static host has no `/__manifest` endpoint, and the
  404 breaks every client-side navigation silently. `routeDiscovery: { mode: 'initial' }`
  is deliberate.
- Do not change a country's `slug` once shipped. It is a public URL.
- Do not load flags from a CDN. They are local files so the app can work offline and so
  no third party sees which countries the user is studying.
- Do not re-introduce coastline simplification (`--detail`) to quiet micro-island noise
  from the unsimplified 1:10m data. Flag it to the owner instead — see the Map engine row
  above.
